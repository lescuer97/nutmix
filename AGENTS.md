## Development instructions

- After finishing a task try compiling the code. 
- Don't leave tasks half way. 
- Never commit or merge code using git. 
- Never add dependencies unless specifically authorized.
- if you don't know how to do something don't guess. It's okey if you don't know.

When scanning source files, use repomix to save space and tokens.
Use the Context7 MCP server to know the latest way to use libraries like `gin` and `templ`.
